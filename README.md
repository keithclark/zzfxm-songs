# ZzFXM Songs

A collection of open source songs for use with [ZzFXM](https://github.com/keithclark/zzfxm).

## Using a song

You can use these songs in your projects but you must abide by the terms of the song license (found in the meta data) and credit the original author if you use or create new songs from their work, if the license dictates so.


## Contribute a song

If you've composed a song you can add it to this repository for others to use in their projects. To add your song, submit a pull request containing your song file ensuring it contains the meta data shown below. The license field is particularly important as it indicates to others what they can (or can't) do with your work.

```js
{
  "title": "My song title",
  "author": "My name",
  "authorUrl": "https://keithclark.co.uk/"
  "license": "CC0",
}
```
